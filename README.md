# Election Dashboard: 2024 General Elections

This project aims to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing election data from the Election Commission website. We'll scrape relevant information using AutoScrapper (a python libraray), clean it using Excel, and visualize insights using Power BI.

## Features
- **Data Scraping**: We'll use **AutoScrapper** to extract election data (results, candidates, constituencies) from the Election Commission website.
